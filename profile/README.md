## 🚀 Features & How It Works

### 🔹 **1. Profile Creation**
- Users **sign up and verify their identity**.
- Complete profiles with **career, hobbies, values, and relationship goals**.

### 🔹 **2. Blind Matchmaking**
- Matches are assigned based on **compatibility, not appearance**.
- **Photos and full bios remain hidden** for **24 hours**.
- Users receive **one random key detail** about their match (e.g., job, hobby, education).

### 🔹 **3. The 24-Hour Conversation Window**
- Users **can only chat via text** during this period.
- Encourages **genuine interactions** before making judgments.

### 🔹 **4. Match Decision**
- **"I want to know more" → If both agree, profiles & photos are revealed.**
- **"Not interested" → Match closes immediately.**
- **If one declines, the other has 30 minutes to reconsider.**
